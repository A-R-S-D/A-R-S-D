- Iâ€™m currently working on a home automation project using mostly ESP32 MCUs at <a href="https://github.com/NotrixInc">@NotrixInc<a/>.
- I love embedded systems and modern C++ programming. have learned a lot about STM32, ESP32, AVR MCUs, and their respective platforms including STM32Cube, Arduino, and Codevision. I'm also highly interested in computer networks and database concepts and contributed to these courses in <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en/">AUT</a> during my BSE.
  - Embedded systems and Assembly Language as TA and head TA for four semesters
  - Computer Networking for two semesters
  - Principles of Database Design for one semester
My MS.C. is concentrated in AI fields. So I'm keenly looking forward to opportunities to deepen my knowledge and fulfill my enthusiasm, in this field. Especially if it's associated with the IoT ecosystem.
