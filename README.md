### Hi!
- Iâ€™m currently working on a home automation project using mostly ESP32 MCUs at <a href="https://github.com/NotrixInc"> @NotrixInc<a/>. I love embedded systems and modern C++ programming. 

- I have learned alot about STM32, AVR, ESP32 MCUs and their respective platforms including Codevision, STM32Cube and Arduino.
